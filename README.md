# One hour project: freewrite - A single page application for online notetaking

The project files in this repo are part of a personal challenge I gave myself to try and to see how far I could get on
a person project if only timeboxed 1 hour to work on it. "freewrite" is the result of exactly 1 timed hour of coding/research
into creating a real-time updating/saving notetaking app that uses ReactJS/Express/Firestore.
